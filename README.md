This repository contains data analysis of Sprocket Central Pty Ltd data set provided by KPMG AU.
I am excited to share with you my recent accomplishment of completing the KPMG Data Analytics Consulting Virtual Internship from Forage. This internship has provided me with invaluable experience and knowledge in the field of data analytics.

Throughout the internship, I successfully completed three modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of data analytics:

Data Quality Assessment: In this module, I learned how to assess the quality of data by identifying and addressing any inconsistencies, errors, or missing values. By ensuring data accuracy and integrity, I laid a strong foundation for the subsequent analysis.

Data Insights: This module allowed me to delve into the customer dataset provided by KPMG. Through various analytical techniques, such as RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, I was able to uncover valuable insights and trends regarding customer behavior and preferences. This information proved crucial in identifying opportunities for the company to boost its business.

Data Presentation: The final module focused on effectively communicating the results of the data analysis. I utilized tools like Excel and Tableau to visualize the findings in a clear and concise manner. This not only enhanced the understandability of the data but also enabled me to present actionable recommendations to the organization.

One of the primary objectives of this internship was to assist KPMG in identifying the 1000 new customers who would provide the most value to the organization. By applying the skills and techniques acquired during the internship, I successfully determined the top 1000 customers who are most likely to drive business growth and recommended targeting them for maximum impact.

This internship provided me with hands-on experience in data manipulation, data visualization, and data analysis techniques. I honed my skills using industry-standard tools such as Excel and Tableau, further solidifying my expertise in these areas.

I am immensely grateful for the opportunity to participate in the Data Analytics Virtual Internship with KPMG sponsored by Forage. The knowledge and skills gained throughout this experience will undoubtedly contribute to my future endeavors in the field of data analytics.
